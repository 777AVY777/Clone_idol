# View markdown files in your browser

If you prefer to follow this guide with the files downloaded from the repository, follow these steps to turn your browser into a smart markdown viewer.

Google Chrome is a good choice if you are able to install an extension:

- Open Google Chrome
- Install [Markdown Preview Plus](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/febilkbfcbhebfnokafefeacimjdckgl?utm_source=chrome-app-launcher-info-dialog)
- Navigate to Menu > More tools > Extensions (direct address: `chrome://extensions/`)
- To enable linking between README files, in the Markdown Preview Plus section, enable the option `Allow access to file URLs`.
- For the final configuration, follow the link to extension options:
  - Select `Enable HTML content Note: Take care for XSS attack if you enable this option` .
  - (Optionally) Set the default theme to `GitHub`.

You can now re-open this README file in Google Chrome and proceed through the tutorials following links as you would on the GitHub site.

First stop: back to the top-level tutorial [README](../README.md).
